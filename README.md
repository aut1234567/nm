# Document Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Introduction

This project aims to implement document classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Document classification involves categorizing text documents into predefined classes or categories. CNNs, which are primarily used in image recognition tasks, can also be applied to sequential data like text through methods such as word embeddings and one-dimensional convolutions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of text documents labeled with their respective categories. It is essential to preprocess the text data before feeding it into the CNN model. Preprocessing steps may include tokenization, removing stopwords, and converting text to numerical representations such as word embeddings.

## Architecture

The CNN architecture for text classification typically consists of the following layers:

1. **Embedding Layer**: This layer converts words into dense vectors called embeddings. Each word is represented by a fixed-size vector, and these vectors are learned during the training process.
   
2. **Convolutional Layer**: Convolutional filters slide over the embedded sequences to extract local features. The output of this layer is a set of feature maps.
   
3. **Pooling Layer**: Max-pooling or average-pooling is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps while retaining the most important information.
   
4. **Fully Connected Layer**: The output of the pooling layer is flattened and fed into one or more fully connected layers, followed by a softmax layer for classification.

## Training

The model is trained using the labeled dataset. The training process involves optimizing the model's parameters to minimize a loss function, typically categorical cross-entropy in the case of multi-class classification tasks. Training is performed using backpropagation and optimization algorithms such as Adam or stochastic gradient descent (SGD).

## Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated on a separate validation or test dataset to assess its performance. Common evaluation metrics for classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of filters, and filter sizes can significantly impact the performance of the CNN model. Hyperparameter tuning techniques like grid search or random search can be employed to find the optimal set of hyperparameters.

## Conclusion

Document classification using CNNs offers a powerful approach for automatically categorizing text documents. By leveraging the hierarchical feature learning capabilities of CNNs, accurate classification results can be achieved across various domains. This README provides a brief overview of the project, including data preprocessing, model architecture, training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
